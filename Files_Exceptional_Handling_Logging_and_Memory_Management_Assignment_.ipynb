        "A) 1. Releasing System Resources\n",
        "When you open a file, the operating system allocates certain system resources, such as file descriptors or memory, to handle the file operations. If you donâ€™t close the file after using it, those resources are not released, potentially leading to resource leaks. In the case of a program that opens many files without closing them, the system may run out of file descriptors or other resources, which can prevent opening new files or cause system instability.\n",

        "2. Ensuring Data is Written to the File\n",
        "When you write to a file, the data is often not immediately written to the file. Instead, it is buffered in memory to optimize performance. This means that if the file is not closed properly, some data may never be written to the file, causing data loss.\n",
        "\n",

        "3. Avoiding File Corruption\n",
        "If you do not close a file properly (especially when writing to it), the file can become corrupted. This is because the file may still be in the process of being written to or closed by the operating system, and if the program crashes or the file handle is not released, you could lose data or corrupt the fileâ€™s structure.\n",

Keeping files open consumes system resources (like memory and file descriptors), which could affect the performance of your program or other programs that need access to those resources. Closing files when you're done with them helps to free up these resources, making the program more efficient.\n",

        "A) The logging module in Python is a built-in library used for tracking events, errors, or general information that occur during the execution of a program. It allows developers to generate logs that provide valuable insights into the program's behavior, making it easier to debug issues, monitor system performance, and record important events in a structured way."

        "A) The os module in Python provides a way to interact with the operating system, and it includes functions that are essential for file handling and manipulating files and directories. The os module allows you to perform tasks such as checking if a file or directory exists, renaming files, removing files, and managing file paths. It provides a higher-level interface for interacting with the filesystem beyond the built-in file handling functions (open(), read(), write(), etc.)."

        "A) In Python, multithreading is particularly beneficial for I/O-bound tasks, such as handling network requests, reading and writing files, and improving UI responsiveness. Although the GIL limits the effectiveness of multithreading for CPU-bound tasks, it can still improve performance by allowing concurrent execution of I/O operations. When used appropriately, multithreading can make applications more responsive, efficient, and scalable, particularly when handling multiple independent tasks or managing background tasks."
